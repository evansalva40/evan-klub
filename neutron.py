Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.When in doubt, print it out.Keep calm and write Python.Programming is like writing a book… except if you miss a single comma, the whole thing crashes.Code like there is no tomorrow.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Code is read more often than it is written.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.neutron.py
