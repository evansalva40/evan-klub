First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.Hello, world!Try, catch, cry.Keyboard not responding. Press F1 to continue.Just because it compiles doesn’t mean it works.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.The only thing worse than a bug is an intermittent bug.Whitespace matters.Premature optimization is the root of all evil.Don’t repeat yourself (DRY).Deploy first, ask questions later.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.If your code works the first time, check again.Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it’s broken.Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.If code was easy, everyone would do it.Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature."Temporary" workarounds become permanent.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Debugging is fun… until it’s not.Your code is only as good as your last commit.Segmentation fault (core dumped).The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck.The best way to learn is to break something.Most coding problems can be solved by taking a break.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.Push small changes frequently.Git happens.Errors are just opportunities to learn.The best code is no code at all.First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.When in doubt, print it out.Keep calm and write Python.Programming is like writing a book… except if you miss a single comma, the whole thing crashes.Code like there is no tomorrow.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Code is read more often than it is written.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.neutron.py
